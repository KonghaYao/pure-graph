# Auth Overview

Open LangGraph Server lets you choose how you handle authentication, so you can secure access to your application's endpoints using the identity system that fits your stack.

You can start with simple shared secret authentication and switch to providers like Better Auth when you need more advanced identity features.

## Available providers

-   [Better Auth](./better-auth.md) - Complete authentication solution with multiple providers
-   [Custom Auth](./custom-auth.md) - Implement simple API key or JWT authentication
